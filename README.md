## Description

This project is a simplified front-end clone of Airbnb's Experiences page. It's built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, demonstrating the use of components, props, and responsive design.

## Features

- Responsive navbar with Airbnb logo
- Hero section with image and descriptive text
- Horizontally scrollable card section for experiences
- Dynamic badge display on cards (SOLD OUT, ONLINE)
- Star ratings and review counts for each experience

## Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Project Structure

- `App.jsx`: The main component that renders Navbar, Hero, and Card components
- `Navbar.jsx`: Contains the navigation bar with the Airbnb logo
- `Hero.jsx`: Displays the hero image and introductory text
- `Card.jsx`: Reusable component for each experience card
- `data.js`: Contains the data for experience cards (not shown in the provided files)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

## How it Works

The app renders a series of Card components based on data imported from `data.js`. Each card displays information about an experience, including an image, location, title, price, and availability status.
